This project is based on React with TypeScript and uses Vite as the build tool.

Even though the project is based on React, preference is given to web components and React is used to enhance the web components and fill gaps in the web platform.

Code must always adhere to the web content accessibility guidelines.

Always use well formed and semantic HTML.

The project uses pure CSS with no external libraries.

## JavaScript

For code such as the following:

```
if (!metadata) return null;
```

Always use curcly braces. In other words:

```
if (!metadata) {
    return null;
}
```

### Function and class comments

When providing function and class comments, always use JSDoc style comments.
Ensure that comments are concise, but clear.
